# iotproject
## Overview
This was a project for my UMSL IoT security class. I designed a garage door opener using Python Flask framework. I utilized a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins along with a magnet sensor to detect if the garage was open or closed and I used a relay to circuit a garage door remote to send the signal to open/close the garage door.
